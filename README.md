Various quality of life features that usually would take more than one mod to have.

> [!WARNING]
> This mod is very early in development and was made for a small server of 4 players, backup your worlds.

### Features:
- Turn Firewood into 3 sticks using any saw.
- Quickly teleport to someone using `/tpp <player>`.
- Sort all open inventories by pressing R.

#### TODO

- Add CI.
- Config file to enable/disable certain features.
- Move `/tpp` to `/tp` by modifying the original command and remove the need of using `<source> <destination>` when teleporting to a player.
- Change behaviour of sorting all open inventories to just the one the player is hovering.
- Overall improvements to the code.
- Fix SonarQube warnings.
