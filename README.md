### Features:
- Turn Firewood into 3 sticks using any saw.
- Quickly teleport to someone using `/tpp <player>`.
- Sort all open inventories or the one being hovered by pressing `R`.

#### TODO
- Configuration to enable/disable certain features.
- Move `/tpp` to `/tp` by modifying the original command and remove the need of using `<source> <destination>` when teleporting to a player.
- Overall improvements to the code.
